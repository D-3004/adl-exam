Aim: To understand terraform lifecycle, core concepts/terminologies and install it on a Linux Machine.

Steps:
1. Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to manage environments of Operators and Infrastructure teams. To download go to site:
https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html 
Select the appropriate package for your operating system and architecture. 

2. unzip the archive by using below command:
unzip file.zip

3. Change the directory to unzipped folder
cd unzip-folder

4. Move the terraform binary to a directory included in your system's PATH in my case 
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/

5. To check whether Terraform is installed, run:
terraform -v
